# Private CV

This project aims to create a website to present a CV without any personal information. Recruiters can make a request to access the information they want to see by adding it to a cart. The owner of the CV will approve or reject the request, and if approved, the recruiter will receive a token valid for 48 hours to access the requested information. Otherwise, the information will be blurred, like a skeleton CV. Recruiters can click on the sections they want to read and add them to the cart before sending their request. Recruiters must connect with an OTP to send a request. There will also be a contact form if the recruiter wants to contact the owner of the CV without adding any information to the cart. In addition to these features, the recruiter can download a PDF version of the CV containing only the information they requested and that the owner authorized. It will also be possible to do a mini-tutorial to discover the owner's last name without session validation. To do this, the recruiter can add the last name to the cart and then validate the cart.

## Motivation

I wanted to have a way to show my CV to recruiter, without having any personal information accessible on the internet.
